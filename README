Recreational mathematics: The Kaprekar constant 6174

Any 4-digit number ends up in the Kaprekar constant if the Kaprekar operation is recursively done to it: 
Form the biggest and the smallest number one can form with the four digits, and subtract them. 

The number of steps (nsteps) required to reach the Kaprekar constant follows a curious pattern. 
This script generates a plot showing nsteps for any number N=XY, as a function of X and Y.
